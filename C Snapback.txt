Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
Bulls jacket with his soul
George Bush got the game back
C snapback 

Someone to stay
You do you feel the way
Selling bar, candy,
Oh, no longer confused but don't tell anybody

It's something that gotta perk
That little thing by the twos man, Noah's Ark
And you don't really care
Seen through the fire
